## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Standards

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return types
- Write docstrings for all public classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and small (preferably under 50 lines)
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Example Code Style

```python
def scan_for_xss(self, pages: List[WebPage]) -> List[Finding]:
    """
    Scan crawled pages for XSS vulnerabilities.
    
    Args:
        pages: List of crawled web pages to scan
        
    Returns:
        List of XSS findings
    """
    findings: List[Finding] = []
    
    for page in pages:
        # Implementation here
        pass
        
    return findings
```

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use pytest for testing
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high code coverage (>80%)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_module.py
```

### Test Structure

```python
def test_xss_scanner_detects_reflected_xss(mocker):
    # Arrange
    config = ScanConfig(target_url="http://example.com")
    scanner = XSSScanner(config)
    
    # Mock HTTP response
    mock_response = mocker.Mock()
    mock_response.text = "<html>Hello <script>alert('XSS')</script></html>"
    mocker.patch('boltvuln.utils.safe_request', return_value=mock_response)
    
    # Act
    findings = scanner._scan_url_parameters("http://example.com?input=test", ["<script>alert('XSS')</script>"])
    
    # Assert
    assert len(findings) == 1
    assert findings[0].module == "xss"
```

## üì¶ Dependencies

### Adding New Dependencies

1. Add to `pyproject.toml` using Poetry
2. Update `requirements.txt` accordingly
3. Document in README if user-facing

### Optional Dependencies

For optional features, add them as extras in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poetry.extras]
pdf = ["weasyprint"]
headless = ["playwright"]
tls = ["sslyze"]
```

## üê≥ Docker

When adding new dependencies or making changes that affect Docker:

1. Update `Dockerfile` if needed
2. Test Docker build locally
3. Update documentation if necessary

## üìñ Documentation

### README Updates

Update README.md when:
- Adding new features
- Changing command-line interface
- Modifying installation process

### Docstrings

Write comprehensive docstrings for:
- All public classes
- All public methods
- All public functions
- Module-level documentation for complex modules

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows the style guidelines
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Verify all tests pass
5. Create a pull request with a clear description
6. Link any related issues
