cd BoltVulnScanner
pip install -r requirements.txt
boltvulnscan ui
```

### First Scan
1. Launch the web UI
2. Enter a target URL (e.g., a test site)
3. Select modules to scan
4. Run a demo scan
5. Explore the findings

## Demo Script

### Web UI Walkthrough
1. Show the clean, intuitive interface
2. Demonstrate module selection
3. Run a demo scan on a sample target
4. Explore findings in the interactive viewer
5. Generate and download a report

### CLI Example
```bash
# Basic scan
boltvulnscan scan --target http://example.com --checks xss,sqli

# Full active scan (with consent)
boltvulnscan scan --target http://example.com --enable-active --confirm-legal "I CONSENT TO ACTIVE TESTS"

# Generate reports
boltvulnscan report --input reports/scan.json --format md,pdf
```
